# Typing Speed Calculator

This repository contains a Python script that calculates the typing speed of a user. The script measures the number of words typed per minute (WPM) and calculates the accuracy of the typed text. It provides a simple and interactive graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library.

## Project Overview

The Typing Speed Calculator is a tool that allows users to test and improve their typing speed. It presents a predefined text to the user, who then types the text in an input field. The script tracks the time taken to complete the typing and calculates the WPM and accuracy based on the entered text.

## Features

The Typing Speed Calculator offers the following features:

1. **Interactive GUI**: The script provides an intuitive graphical user interface where users can start the typing test, view the timer, enter their text, and see the calculated WPM and accuracy.

2. **Predefined Text**: The script includes a predefined text passage that users can type. This text can be modified in the script to suit different test scenarios.

3. **Timer**: The script includes a timer that starts counting when the user starts typing. It displays the elapsed time in seconds.

4. **WPM Calculation**: The script calculates the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on the number of words entered and the time taken to complete the typing. It updates the WPM value in real-time as the user types.

5. **Accuracy Calculation**: The script calculates the accuracy of the typed text by comparing it with the predefined text. It counts the number of correct words and calculates the accuracy as a percentage. The accuracy value is updated in real-time as the user types.

6. **Start and Reset**: The script provides buttons to start the typing test and reset the timer, input field, WPM, and accuracy values for a new test.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code.

2. Make sure you have Python and the Tkinter library installed on your machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the script `typing_speed_calculator.py` using Python.

5. The graphical user interface (GUI) window will open, displaying the title, predefined text, input field, start button, reset button, and WPM/accuracy labels.

6. Click the "START" button to start the typing test.

7. Begin typing the text in the input field. The timer will start counting the elapsed time.

8. As you type, the WPM and accuracy values will be updated in real-time.

9. After completing the typing, view the calculated WPM and accuracy.

10. To reset the test and start again, click the "Reset" button.

11. You can close the GUI window to exit the application.
